#Rescursion
1. What is Recursion?
Recursion is a function calling itself until base condion / terminating condition is met. If no base condition is met we might get
stackoverflow error because computer doesn't have unlimited memory.  Recusrsion is parent for may other techniques like 
back tracking, dynamic programming, dividing and conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms etc.
base condition is very importnant for recursion

2. When to use Recursion?
you need a solve a problem, divide it in to smaller problems, solve ese , use this soltuion
to the original solution
similar to original problem. Always try to write a base case and a recursive case
3.Visualization : Recursion Tree, Recursion Call stack
recursion tree and recursion call stack very important to calculate the the space complexity. and also time complexity


3. Recursion vs Iteration
4. Ways to write Base condition
5. Recursice leap of faith
how to use recursion
  understand the problem
  identify the subproblem
  trust/ faith
   trust the recursive call , don't try to simlulate mentally
  link 1 and 2
  base condition can be last valid input or first invalid input
